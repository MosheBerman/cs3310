Logisim-Assignments
===================

My logisim assignments for Computer Architecture at Brooklyn College. (CS 3310) 

The lab assignments for the first half of this class were done in [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), a cross-platform circuitry simulator written in Java. Those are what you see here.

If you're looking for my assembly code from the second half of this course, those are in different repositories: 

- Hellow World in assembly #1 is [here](https://github.com/MosheBerman/Asm).
- Assembly lab #2, which takes an argument and uses it, is [here](https://github.com/MosheBerman/assembly-params).


About Logisim:
---

--According the developer, Logisim is no longer in development as of October 2014, (sometime during the semester when I took the course using it,) but it works well enough, and is still available for download.-- EDIT: There's a new version available called [Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution). 

Note that you need to run it with a flag to enable the "combinational analysis" functionality. There's [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution/issues/5) explaining why this is.

The source for Logisim [can be downloaded from SourceForge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/).

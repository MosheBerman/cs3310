CS3310
===================

My logisim assignments for Computer Architecture at Brooklyn College. (CS 3310) 

The lab assignments for the first half of this class were done in [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), a cross-platform circuitry simulator written in Java. Those are in the logisim directory. 

The second half of the class studied 32-bit yasm assemby language. Those assignments are in the assembly directory. In there, you'll find a few subfolders, each for an assignment.

- argument: A lab which takes an argument and uses it.
- controlstructures: Contains a few control structures examples.
- countbits: bit shifts a number to count the number of bits flipped on.
- CPPandAssembly: A lab which calls an assembly routine from C++.
- hello: Hello World in assembly.



About Logisim:
---

~~According the developer, Logisim is no longer in development as of October 2014, (sometime during the semester when I took the course using it,) but it works well enough, and is still available for download.~~ The source for Logisim [can be downloaded from SourceForge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/).
 
There's a new version available called [Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution). Note that you need to run it with a flag to enable the "combinational analysis" functionality. There's [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution/issues/5) explaining why this is.

Logisim-Assignments
===================

My logisim assignments for Computer Architecture at Brooklyn College. (CS 3310) 

The lab assignments for the first half of this class were done in [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), a cros-platform circuitry simulator written in Java.

About Logisim:

According the developer, Logisim is no longer in development as of October 2014, (sometime during the semester when I took the course using it,) but it works well enough, and is still available for download.

The source for Logisim [can be downloaded from SourceForge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/).
